Tools for research
===
1. [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is/){:target="_blank"} - Never lose annotations by stopping annotating on paper and annotating on the web. Allows you to collaborate, supports LaTeX.
 - [Liner](http://getliner.com/login/){:target='_blank'} - Might be a better alternative. No LaTeX support as of yet though.
2. [Evernote](https://evernote.com/){:target="_blank"} - If you want to keep daily logs and have them be searchable, look no further.
3. [RefME](https://www.refme.com/){:target="_blank"} - Free reference generator!
4. [puush](http://puush.me/){:target="_blank"} - Instead of {Screenshot, upload, generate link to image}, just screenshot.
5. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/dash){:target="_blank"} - Online collaborative writing and publishing system. LaTeX on the cloud really.
